Capital One - Summit Challenge 2017

A visual representation of some Airbnb trend data from 2007 - 2016. The data showed trends in pricing, neighborhood popularity as well as hosts tendencies. 

The Task: To solve this challenge, build a web application that provides the following functionality:

Visualize the data: Graph some (any 3) interesting metrics, maps, or trends from the dataset.
Price estimation: Given the geo-location (latitude and longitude) of a new property, estimate the weekly average income the homeowner can make with Airbnb.
Bookings optimization: Given the geo-location (latitude and longitude) of a property, what is the ideal price per night that will yield maximum bookings or revenue?

Motivation: 
Keen to learn more about software engineering and pick up new skills I jumped in head first picking up a lot of new skills and working with totally unfamiliar languages and libraries: like JavaScript, ChartJS and JQuery. 

Hopefully this project can be used to show consumers where to best invest their money in the city of San Francisco to remain competitive in the apartment rental industry.
